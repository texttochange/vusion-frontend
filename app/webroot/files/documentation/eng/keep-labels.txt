<b>Keep Labels</b> is a feature that enables participants to keep some of the profile/label information (e.g name: John or age: 30 etc) they originally had as the reset action takes place.
<li>Label names should be written in a comma separated list like name, age...</li>
<li>Leave this field blank if you do not wish to retain any labels</li>
